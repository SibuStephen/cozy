This is an experiment that will try to implement a simple REST backend that uses the local filesystem for persistence.

- It will be based on Sinatra because Sinatra appears to support simple REST setups well.
- The basic CRUD operations will allow client-side javascript, which is properly authenticated, to interact with the local filesystem

##Simplest Slice
- The simplest implementation will allow for a single or maybe 2 functions with no authentication (or basic HTTP, if at all)
- Then, maybe add some simple JS that interacts with it
